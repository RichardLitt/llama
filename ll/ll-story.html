<h3>Llárriésh Narrative</h3>

Here is what I've managed to translate of a Gene Wolfe short story into Llárriésh. The story can be found in The Book of the New Sun, the best fantasy book this side of eternity. 

<div>
<h2><strong>Hallvard's Story: </strong></h2>

<p class="p1"><i>I come from Glaicies, which is the northernmost of the islands. On our island live a man and a woman, who are my grandparents. They had three sons. They were named Anskar, Hallvard, and Gundulf. I became large enough that I was able to begin helping on the fishing boat. Because of this he stopped hunting and fishing with his brothers. Instead, we toiled together, so that fish were caught and brought home to my mother, and my older sisters and brothers. </i></p> 
 
<p class="p1"><i>*****</i></p> 
 
<ul class="ul1"> 
  <li class="li1"><b>dáshî</b> can be the reduced form of <b>dáo</b>. Also, note that the copula can be left out occasionally. (although never when providing attribution with <b>fa</b> or <b>ró</b>.) </li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>ró</b> is interchangeable with <b>kyu</b>, although the latter is more commonly used for attribution, while the first more often deals with physical possession. </li> 
  <li class="li1">the relative clause clipping can be dropped, if a pause is added, and if it is next to the verb being modified. </li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>ú</b> is the indefinite article.</li> 
  <li class="li1">Names and fathers are inalienable. This is a fluid category, and doesn't stop with the body.</li> 
  <li class="li1">A coordinating conjunction is not needed for lists. </li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>í</b> is an article (perhaps better called a clitic) which is used with any word to make it a noun. It is also a stative verb, of sorts. It's hard to pin down. The best translation of this sentence might be: <i>I lived, changing, until I became large</i>. But it could also be translated as<i> I lived to the point of being large</i>. Or <i>of having the largeness</i>. I'm not sure <b>í</b> works, grammatically - it certainly wouldn't in English - but we'll run with it until I run into some serious errors. It only works as a derivational morpheme - it cannot, for instance, work for a noun. Perhaps "<i>the quality of being large exists</i>" is a good translation. <i>I lived changing until the quality of being large existed. </i></li> 
  <li class="li1">If a verb is being used with the same aspects and clitics as a preceding verb, they can all be dropped.</li> 
  <li class="li1">tuntíbesh is an irregular paucal form. For pronouns, the &lt;y&gt; and &lt;w&gt; are not inserted between identical vowels. </li>

<p class="p1"><i>So my uncles never married, and so they continued to share a boat.</i> <i>They caught fish. They ate those themselves, or gave them to my grandparents, as they were no longer strong. In the summer, they would regularly farm my grandfather's land. My grandfather had the best land on that island. The land is in a valley, which alone hears the ice wind. You could grow things which would probably not ripen in other paces on Glaicies because in that valley the growing season is two weeks longer. </i></p> 
  
<p class="p1">*****</p> 
  
<ul class="ul1"> 
  <li class="li1">According to my own rules, the oft cited word <b>muténún </b><i>to eat</i> is illegally spelled, and ought to be <b>mucénún</b>. Luckily, I have the power to change things. Here, I am going to say that, since this is such a common word, it is actually at the forefront of a sound change, and the [t] doesn't palatalise. </li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>Dîntuá</b> is a perfectly respectable construction: contracted plural (here paucal) plus the =tuá, which basically equates to "-selves". </li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>fï</b> is an odd word. It means, instinctively, 'or'. However, it is used for choices which can occur repeatedly: sometimes they would do this, or they would do that. <b>tïr</b> is used for a choice that is irrevocable or only occurs once: do this or do this. The brick is yellow, or it is red. Both of these words tend towards being used for complete lists. The correct terminology which I ought to use for this is escaping me. Another word, <b>hoï </b> is used for incomplete lists: Either give him the apple or the orange or something else. It can be used in place of either<b> tïr </b>or(<b>fï</b>) <b>fï</b>. We'll see how this pans out, in the long run, I hope. Oh, note the word <b>rohô</b>, which means nor, pretty much in any environment (at this point). </li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>oï</b> is an adjective of sorts, but it's more of a counter. It's used to refer to a couple, in particular a married or mated pair. It takes singular noun agreement, but the verb takes plural agreement (not paucal). </li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>mo</b> is my answer to my ill-ease with my temporal clauses. Basically, this is a derived form of <b>boá </b>(arguably the most important Llárri word). What this says is that in the speaking, it is this time, or this way. Again, terminology is escaping me. I need to go back to school. In mo dáo clauses, no conjunction is needed for the following clause. The dáo can also be deleted, like normal, if it's repetitive. </li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>wáf</b> is an adjective meaning <i>best</i>. <b>geï</b> is used for <i>better</i>, and can be used as a coordinator between two adjectives or clauses to indicate that the first one is better than the second. <b>yana</b> can be used in the same way to indicate <i>worse. </i><b>gin</b> is the superlative form for <i>worst.</i><b><i> </i></b>All of these can also be used after an adjective, followed by <b>ee</b>, to indicate the superlative (best, most, greatest), comparative (better, more, greater), and superlative pejorative (worst, least, smallest), and comparative perjorative (worse, lesser, smaller). </li> 
  <li class="li1">Relative clauses do not need to follow the words they modify immediately. </li> 
  <li class="li1">Two modal verbs are allowed, and must follow immediately after each other.</li> 
</ul>

<p class="p1"><i>My beard was beginning to sprout. My grandfather called the men of my family together; that is, father, uncles, and I. We got to his house. My grandmother was dead. A priest from the big island was there to lay out the body. Her sons wept, as I did myself. </i></p>

  <li class="li1">In lists of three or more, no and is needed. Neither is genitive attribution, unless it isn't clear from context.</li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>oho </b>mainly functions at adding a second subject, or clarifying information by adding the information of a previous clause to another noun. It pretty much translates as "as __", but doesn't work in metaphoric usage or simultaneous time alone.</li>

<ul class="ul1"> 
  <li class="li1"><b>So…so</b> is a construction that's a lot like "on the one hand…on the other", but it indicates not just two sides, but two extremes or camps. So, here, the grandfather and the priest are on opposite sides of the table, and markedly so. </li> 
  <li class="li1"><b>üskódá </b>is, essentially the active participle. Note that the passive participle is with <b>=dú</b>, not <b>=dá</b>. They are a bit different in their origination, as the first means things, and the second is the adjectival suffix from dáo. </li>
